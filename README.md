# Taurit.Toolkit

## About the project

This solution contains a set of small tools that help me simplify my everyday workflow.

They are not intended as generic solutions and will probably not be of any use to anyone else.

## Tool list

Currenty the toolkit contains:

* __Taurit.Toolkit.CompressVideo__. Wrapper for _ffmpeg_ that allows to convert any video file into mp4 format (using x264 + aac codecs). I have a shortcut for it on Total Commander's button bar, which allows me to convert files simply by dragging them into application's icon.
